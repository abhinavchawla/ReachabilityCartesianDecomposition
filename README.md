# ReachabilityCartesianDecomposition
An implementation of the paper "Reach set approximation through decomposition with low-dimensional sets and high-dimensional matrices" in Python using the zonotope set representation. 

This is a faster way to approximate reach set approximations where the initial set is decomposed into multiple smaller sets and we try to create a reachability analysis on these smaller sets while exponentiating the high dimensional phi matrix at every step. This implementation uses the zonotope as the set representation and is implemented in Python.
